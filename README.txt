Getting started:

1. Build the mp3 executable with the make file.
2. Locate a folder where all of your .mp3's are located. 
3. Run the program, when it asks to load, say no. Now enter the path found in step 1.
4. To start playing, use the play command with the name of a song.
For example: play "test.mp3"
5. To skip a song, enter s.
   To quit, enter quit.
   To peek ahead at what are the top predicted songs, enter peek with the number of songs. For example, peek 10.
   To make one of these the next song played, enter that number (or enter 0 for no change).
